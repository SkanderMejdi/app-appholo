Technical Constraints:

APPHOLO was bootstrapped with Create React Native App.. 
Enabling a multiplatform application (iOS & Android) and a react environnement with a noSQL database structure (Mongoose and MongoDB).

A reactive database means more flexibility for the mobile application and a capacity of handling heavy tasks.

Troubleshooting :

Networking

If the « Waiting for network to come back » error occurs please check your phone connection.
